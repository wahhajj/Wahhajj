# About Me


**wahhajj/Wahhajj** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


- 🔭 **Current projects:** I’m currently working on my first game in unity which is a rolling ball game. I decided to use that game as a way of learning other skills outside of what the UnityLearn tutorial teaches, rather I had gained the skills to make timers, menus, different scenes, buttons, Countdowns etc. It also pushed me to improve my prompting skills with ChatGPT. I am also in the making of an EPQ about AI, which is a research project exploring the development of AI, from it's history, to the present, and it's potential in the future.
- 🌱 **Current studies:** I’m currently learning how to code in c#, in my game I am currently learning how to make a leaderboard. For my research project, I am currently gathering information from different books such as - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence by *Wolfgang Ertel*; Artificial Intelligence: Foundations of Computational Agents by *David L. Poole* and *Alan K. Mackworth*.
- 🏢 **Aspirations:** As of now, I am still exploring, however, I have found a deep interest and passion for coding, so I know for sure that I want to explore the tech industry.
